# simuhaplo_functions
**example1** - How to use `gen.simuHaplo`  
**example2** - How to use `gen.simuHaplo_traceback` with the output of `gen.simuHaplo` to trace inherited segments up their path of inheritance  
**example3** - How to use `gen.simuHaplo_compare_IBD` with the output of `gen.simuHaplo` to compare proband's haplotypes and identify regions of IBD (true IBD state since we know ancestral origin of each segment)  
**reconstruct.pl** - A script to convert the output files of `gen.simuHaplo` into marker data, given marker data for all the founders.
